            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This Project is made in colloboration with <a href="#credits">these</a> trackers, who each recorded the various transactions of Hermitcraft members. We were only interested in transactions that were made with diamonds. All episodes from each hermit were checked and we incorporated as many livestreams as we could. </p>

        <div id="sankeyText" class="expText"><div class="explainer"><h3>Who is trading with who 2?</h3>This Sankey diagram is another way of representing the flow of diamonds between hermits.<br><br> You can find your favourite hermit and trace the lines from the Payers (The ones who spend the diamonds) to the Payee (The ones who receive the diamonds.) This way you can easily track how many diamonds were traded between 2 hermits over the whole season indicated by the thickness of the ribbon connecitng them, as well as a really good indication of how much a hermit spent and received in total over the season indicated by the height of their bars on the left and right.</div></div>

        <div id="spendText" class="expText"><div class="explainer">Cub is a well known power-spender in the Hermitcraft Economy, with an eloborate set of tunnels under his base to fuel the local economy. <br> Impulse equally spent well, often purchasing from fellow hermits from the convience with the revenue generated from his own shops.<br>  Etho, aka Ladders, with Iskall's wallet purchased just about everything that caught his eye, can't have too much right? <br> And Finally Doc, big ambitions means you need a big wallet right? Despite a trade war, Doc conducted much of his business with Jevin buying beacons and sponges a plenty.</div></div>

                <h3>The battle of the shopping districts.</h3>
                Shopping districts quickly became a central part of this season, but how well do they compare? Boatem takes a very heavy lead in front of any others with the economic powerhouse of the G-Train pushing them forward, a healthily diverse set of shops also sets them apart. <br> Horse Head Farms while a bit of sleeper were able to generate massive swathes of revenue through their IOU auction.<br>The Evil Emporium primarily benefited from the Diamond to Derpcoin exchange<br>Big Eyes were able to make a healthy profit through forcing Keralis to work away underground trading villagers for XP bottles so Mumbo would have XP at his disposal depsite having an "XP farm".<br>Finally Octogan, don't let the diamonds fool you, Ren and Doc raked in with the derpcoin, forming a healthy reserve but unfortunately those are not tracked in our project.

            <h3>Where do Hermits spend their diamonds?</h3>
            This simple pie chart demonstrates the amount of diamonds spend at each store as well as how many diamonds were directly transferred between Hermits. The other cateogry being so large indicates a strong prescence of small and unique businesses that make a few dozen diamonds

            <h3>When do Hermits spend their diamonds?</h3>
            This pyramid graph is a visualisation of where hermits spend their diamonds, in terms of on stream or in videos according to our tracking. Each hermit has 2 bars, one representing what percent of their total diamonds spend were on stream and how many were in a video. A few hermits don't stream but the ones that do generally tend to spend their diamonds on stream as often as on camera.

                <h3>How did the Hermits' fortune form over time?</h3>
                In this racing bar chart we can clearly see the progression of the hermit's fortune over the course of the season from sales at their shops by month. You can see how quickly Grian steams ahead from September to November, a very good few months for the G-Train.

                <h3>Spending vs Earning</h3>
                We can see here a comparision between how many diamonds each Hermit spends and how many they make back in their shops. Some Hermits hold very tightly to their riches, rarely spending which can act as an inflation control measure. Whereas others are equally keen to dump money back into the economy as they were to profit from it, with Pearl, Scar, Impulse, Tango, xB and Gem all having roughly equal spending and earning whereas Cub and Etho far outspend their shops' revenue generation.
