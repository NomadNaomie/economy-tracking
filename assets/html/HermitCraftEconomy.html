            <h1>Hermitcraft <b>Season 8 Economy</b></h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This Project is made in colloboration with <a href="#credits">these</a> trackers, who each recorded the various transactions of Hermitcraft members. We were only interested in transactions that were made with diamonds. All episodes from each hermit were checked and we incorporated as many livestreams as we could. </p>

        <div id="chordText" class="expText"><div class="explainer"><h3>Who is trading with who?</h3>This chord diagram represents the flow of diamonds between hermits. <br> <br> You can hover over a hermit's name to see all transactions in and out or hover over an individual ribbon to see how many diamonds transferred between 2 specific hermits during Season 8. <br> <br> Selecting a hermit in the dropdown will highlight transactions between them and other hermits without having to hover. </div></div>
        <div id="sankeyText" class="expText"><div class="explainer"><h3>Who is trading with who 2?</h3>This Sankey diagram is another way of representing the flow of diamonds between hermits.<br><br> You can find your favourite hermit and trace the lines from the Payers (The ones who spend the diamonds) to the Payee (The ones who receive the diamonds.) This way you can easily track how many diamonds were traded between 2 hermits over the whole season indicated by the thickness of the ribbon connecitng them, as well as a really good indication of how much a hermit spent and received in total over the season indicated by the height of their bars on the left and right.</div></div>

                <h3>What do Hermits spend their diamonds on?</h3>
            This diagram shows how many diamonds each category of transaction was responsible for. Books and Building Blocks seem to be the bedrock of Hermit economy with Rockets and Shulkers on a massive SMP also being necessary and cash cows.

            <h3>Where do Hermits spend their diamonds?</h3>
            This simple pie chart demonstrates the amount of diamonds spend at each store as well as how many diamonds were directly transferred between Hermits. The other cateogry being so large indicates a strong prescence of small and unique businesses that make a few dozen diamonds

            This pyramid graph is a visualisation of where hermits spend their diamonds, in terms of on stream or in videos according to our tracking. Each hermit has 2 bars, one representing what percent of their total diamonds spend were on stream and how many were in a video.
